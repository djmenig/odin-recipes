        <h2>Classic Marshmellow Fudge</h2>
        <p>This recipe used to be found on the back of a well known brand of marshmallow cream. Many were surprised when it was changed. This is the original! You may find that most packages of chocolate chips are 10 ounces now; 12 ounces of chocolate chips is roughly 2 cups.</p>

            <li>3 cups white sugar</li>

            <li>1 (12 ounce) package semisweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>1 (7 ounce) jar marshmallow creme</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
